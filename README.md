## How to execute
In order to get all of our services up and running we are going to use Docker. <br>
Fire up a terminal and let's get going.
* Clone the repo, i'm using SSH but you can use HTTP or the GitHub CLI:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:gabrielparaizo/CodePix.git
```
* With Docker installed on your machine, just run the following command:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
